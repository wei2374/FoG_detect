#Day1
* Try to reproduce the paper of Florenc. Bad result with direct PCA and LDA on data with window size 2 seconds (64*2) and step 1 second;

* Study about the kernel trick and try the implementation Florenc sent to me as python file.

* The kernel trick is not the same as the method in wikipedia. Try a second implementation from network but still does not have good result.

* Write an email to Florenc and ask him about the kernel trick


#Day2 
* Interview with Florenc and know more about his method. He gives me an implementation which he finds in the internet.

#Day4
* Cannot understand the implementation. Different from the implementation in wikipedia, new algorithm. Only give me bad result when I did kernel LDA with it.

* Ask Forenc again about this, Florenc tries to use it with my data, but also generates only bad results with the test data. I think the kernel lda is overfitting. 

#Day5
* The kernel method implementation in matlab required do a kernel function with X_test and X_train together, which means even it works, it still requires me to save all training data in the memory which is not possible and viable.
